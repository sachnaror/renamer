# File Renamer 🛠️✨

Welcome to **File Renamer**, the tool you never knew you needed until your boss asked you to rename "File_Final_FINAL_v2_ACTUALLYFINAL.docx" to something sane across 12,000 files. 😅

## What Does It Do? 🤔

Simple! It:
- Finds files and folders in a directory and its subdirectories.
- Replaces *that one annoying word* in their names and content.
- Makes your life a tad bit easier (or so we hope).

## Why Use This? 🚀

- You’ve run out of excuses for why your directory still says `OldProject`.
- You're tired of opening files only to manually replace "Lorem Ipsum" 374 times.
- You believe in automation, even if it just helps you avoid doing real work.

## How Do I Use This Sorcery? 🪄

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install file-renamer
